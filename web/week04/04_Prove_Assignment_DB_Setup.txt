1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).
https://github.com/headricked/cs313-php/blob/master/db/myDb.sql


2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
I tried to think of a simple and intuitive way to design and label the database. So I only have two tables: one for the person, and one for the milestone event.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
I spent many hours scouring the Internet to figure out how to subtract two dates from columns of different tables, then return a new column. I think I might need to use the JOIN functionality, but I'm not certain.

4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
One of the coolest things I learned while completing this assignment is that there is a TIMESTAMPTZ data type to return dates and times, including the time zone. This may come in handy if time zones change.

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
One principle of good database design is to organize information into subject-based tables to reduce redundancy. Another principle of good database design is to apply meaningful data types to ensure accurate data.


6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I believe I demonstrated creativity, and went above and beyond the requirements, as evidenced by my generating code that inserts data into the database. This allowed me to see how the data appeared.
