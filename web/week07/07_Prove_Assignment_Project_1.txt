2. The Heroku URL for your web application:

3. The GitHub URL for your source code repository:
https://github.com/headricked/cs313-php/tree/master/web/milestone

4. A link to the SQL file that contains the commands used to create your tables (e.g. a link to the myDb.sql file at GitHub, or something similar).

5. Please provide a brief description of what your project does and how to use the application. Make sure to include any required information like a username and password.
The application allows the user to record and display person and milestone data. The user can carry out the following functions:
a) add a user
b) update a user
c) delete a user
d) add a milestone
e) update a milestone
f) deletee a milestone

6. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
The update a milestone function is not working exactly how it should. When a milestone is updated, it is overwriting another record in the database; specifically, it appears to be overwriting the earliest milestone of the given person.
